    "Ans. A Python String is a sequence of characters. Python Strings are immutable, it means once we declare a string, we can’t modify it. Python provides a built-in class “str” for handling text as the text is the most common form of data that a Python program handles. Following are the common string operations that can be performed in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Concatenation of two or more strings.\n",
    "* Extracting or slicing partial strings from string values.\n",
    "* Adding or removing spaces.\n",
    "* Converting to lower or upper case.\n",
    "* Formatting strings using string formatters.\n",
    "* Finding and/or replacing a text in the given string with some other text.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the list of operations is countless. Python provides several built-in methods that let us to perform operations on a string in a flexible way."
